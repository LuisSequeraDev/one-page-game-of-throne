# one-page-game-of-throne
A simple page of Game of Throne

This page is part of a challenge from "Curso Definitivo de HTML y CSS" on Platzi.

I wanted to add some extra features to make the page look better, so I can show off my creativity and skills so far.

The challenge was to create a simple page with certain positioning characteristics and uses of tags and classes, using HTML and CSS without Flex or Grid, just pure CSS, so this is the result.

In the future I want to use this page as the basis for a feature-specific SPA using a Game of Throne API, and publish that page to all users who want it.
